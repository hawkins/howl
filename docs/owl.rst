Owl Module
==============
Owl.py is a prime example of how to use the Howl framework.
Owl is a solid starting point for new modules. Simply take the file as a coookie-cutter template for making a new bot with Howl, as at the moment we do not have a traditional example bot.

Because Owl uses no new functions, we have nothing to document. Instead, the logging method will be documented here. Note this logger reappears in records.py as well.
